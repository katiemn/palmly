Palmly Project SRS Feedback
==============================

This is a good start!  You have provided good information about the project
and what it will do, what the goals are, and so forth.

There are a couple of things you need to do, though.  I don't see a real
CSCI breakdown, other than your descriptive paragraph describing the two
subsystems.  CSCI breakdown should be more like the following:

2.1  Palmly CSCI Breakdown
<< brief description >>
2.1.1  Database CSC - << description >>
2.1.1.1   Training Data CSU - << description >>
2.1.1.2   Testing Data CSU - << description >>
2.1.1.3   .....and so on......
2.2.1  Neural Network (NN) CSC - << description >>
2.2.1.1   Head Line NN CSU - << description >>
2.2.1.2   Heart Line NN CSU - << description >>
2.2.1.3   Life Line NN CSU - << description >>


THEN, you use that outline structure to specify the functional requirements
section, where the "shall" statements go.  I hope this is clear, but if it
isn't, come see me and I'll help you understand it better.

You'll need a LOT more requirements for this project than the even you have
included here.  Again, I'm available to help you any time!

Make the suggested changes by the end of the semester for full credit!

Nice job on the Gantt chart!

Initial submission 7% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      9% out of 10% = 90% which is an A-minus
