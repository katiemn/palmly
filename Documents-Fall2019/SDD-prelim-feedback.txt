Another great job by Team Palmly!!  

You three are right on top of your game.


I like the descriptions, and you write clearly and to the point.



Just a couple of suggestions:



The use case diagram should show how the SYSTEM will be used by the 
USERS,
not what goes on during development.  You also need a box around 
the ovals
that show the use cases, and there should be something about 
the algorithm
that you are using ~~ an oval for it, at least.



Your "deployment" diagram doesn't really have enought detail for that 
type
 of diagram.  It also is a bit light on the content.  Think about 
what will 
happen when a user wants their palm read, then model the 
flow of THOSE
 activities with a "flow" diagram of some kind; something 
like a sequence 
diagram or an activity diagram.



Other than that, very nice and complete work!




you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
