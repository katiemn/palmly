Another great job by Team Palmly!!  You three are right on top of your game.
I like the descriptions, and you write clearly and to the point.

Just a couple of suggestions:

The use case diagram should show how the SYSTEM will be used by the USERS,
not what goes on during development.  You also need a box around the ovals
that show the use cases, and there should be something about the algorithm
that you are using ~~ an oval for it, at least.

Your "deployment" diagram doesn't really have enought detail for that type
of diagram.  It also is a bit light on the content.  Think about what will
happen when a user wants their palm read, then model the flow of THOSE
activities with a "flow" diagram of some kind; something like a sequence
diagram or an activity diagram.

Other than that, very nice and complete work!

you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
