Another great job by Team Palmly!!  

You three are right on top of your game.


I like the descriptions, and you write clearly and to the point.



Just a couple of suggestions:


You still need to make the changes indicated from last time, to wit:


The use case diagram should show how the SYSTEM will be used by the 
USERS,
not what goes on during development.  You also need a box around 
the ovals
that show the use cases, and there should be something about 
the algorithm
that you are using ~~ an oval for it, at least.



Your "deployment" diagram doesn't really have enought detail for that 
type
 of diagram.  It also is a bit light on the content.  Think about 
what will 
happen when a user wants their palm read, then model the 
flow of THOSE
 activities with a "flow" diagram of some kind; something 
like a sequence 
diagram or an activity diagram.

Other than that, very nice and complete work!

  I love the color diagrams
in the detailed diagrams section.

This is such an imaginative project!  Everyone I mention it to says, "OMFG,
that's SOOOO COOOL!!!"  You ladies really nailed it with this one.


you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
