Hi, ladies ~~~~

I took a look at your poster today and wow, it looks REALLY nice!  The lavender color is great on the title and the arrows and contrasts perfectly with the LMU blue.  The logos are SO COOL, and the screen graphics are perfect.  It all looks lovely!!

There are three things, two small one a bit bigger:
small:  the phrase "in depth" should be hyphenated
        you should put the date or "Spring 2020" on it
large:  the poster should be in PDF not PPTX and needs
          to be 48" x 36" in size

Otherwise, I like it very much!  If you don't want it to be printed, I guess you don't need to worry about the PDF and sizing, but it's such a unique project it would be great if we could print it out at a future date...

Regards,
Dr. Johnson
