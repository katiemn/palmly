Software Requirements Specification
CMSI 402 -- Palmly Project
===================================

Very nice work on this!

The updates reflect the expansion on the design from last semester, and is
a good description of this second part of the project.

With the exception that one will ALWAYS uncover more requirements as the
development progresses, I think you have covered the basics nicely.

You might try to add in a few more requirements as you go, and use this SRS
as the place in which you are documenting things you uncover as time goes on.

Nice job!

You have full credit on this portion of the project.
