# Palmly: Project Proposal
Authors: Katie Nguyen, Sofia Ruiz, Moriah Tolliver

## Description

Palmly will be an iOS application that allows users to take a picture of their hand and receive a palm reading. The reading will detail likely personality traits and thought patterns, even guessing past events the user may have experienced and predicting future events. Users will be able to navigate through different tabs containing helpful tips and lifestyle advice based on the their results. The application will also allow users to save their results as well as post them to Instagram or Facebook. Unlike competitors that require the user to draw lines on the picture of their hand or have substantial monthly fees of up to $15, Palmly will provide an free and intuitive user experience.

## Justification

This project will involve cultivating a dataset as well as training a neural network to look for prominent lines on the hands and identify their shapes to output a reading. The application will also rely on database management to save and retrieve user photos and readings. Additionally, the project will require the use of third party APIs to enable sharing to Facebook and Instagram. The team aims to gain a holistic development experience while integrating all of the previously mentioned technology into Palmly.
